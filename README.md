# JCOM theme

A graphical theme for Janeway.

Derived from theme "material".

## Install

Link/copy/clone the folder `JCOM` into `src/themes/` and then choose
the theme from the journal manager dashboard via the "all settings"
form (probably "styling" would be better, but it does not work for me
now). E.g. `JCOM/manager/settings/` (and search "theme").
